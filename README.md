# Abstract
The Pothole Detection and Avoidance Bot is an intelligent robotic system designed to detect potholes on roads and autonomously navigate around them. Utilizing advanced image processing, sensor integration, and machine learning techniques, the bot enhances road safety and minimizes damage to vehicles. This project is particularly useful for autonomous vehicles, smart city infrastructure, and road maintenance planning.
